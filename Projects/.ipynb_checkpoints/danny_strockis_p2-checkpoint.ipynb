    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "ANSWER: Tf-Idf is different from the Count Vectorizer in that it doesn't use simple word or bigram counts as feature values. It computes a count for each feature that is normalized by the frequency of the feature in the entire corpus of documents. So, features/words that are common in a given document but uncommon in the entire corpus are weighted more heavily in the model. This helps to de-emphasize words that are common in every document, like articles.\n",

    "\n",
    "I would like to explore more whether short documents are in fact troublesome before suggesting any fix. But for the latter problem, it would seem that religious terms should be weighted far more heavily than computer/internet terms. For instance, in the second document, there is only one religious phrase, but that one phrase determines the topic of the entire document. Therefore, an approach to this problem would be to artificially weight religious terms. This could be done with a externally constructed list, or by inspecting the terms heavily weighted in religious documents, and heavily weighting those terms in our model. "
